# The-Pizza-Lounge-Sales-Analysis-Using-PowerBI
The Pizza Lounge sales analysis project involved loading and cleaning data into Power BI to gain insights into customer preferences, peak hours, and sales trends. We found that the Classic category of pizzas was the most popular, peak hour was in the afternoon, and Friday was the busiest day of the week.
As a data analyst, I undertook an analysis of Pizza Lounge sales using Power BI as my primary tool. The dataset consisted of 21350 orders and 49574 items sold, generating a total revenue of 817.86K. I utilized data cleaning techniques to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data, followed by data modeling to provide insights into the business operations of Pizza Lounge.

Using calculated columns and measures, I identified the top-selling pizza varieties, which were Thai Chicken and BBQ Chicken, and the least popular pizzas in terms of revenue, which were Brie_Carre and Green Graden. Additionally, I discovered that the busiest hour of the day was between 12 and 2 p.m., the most popular pizza group was the Classic pizza group, and the busiest day of the week was Friday. Moreover, sales were evenly distributed throughout the year, but they peaked in July.

To visualize the rush hours effectively, I employed conditional formatting techniques. Throughout the project, I used various DAX functions such as Sum, Calculate, and Average, to derive valuable insights and trends from the data.

Overall, my analysis of Pizza Lounge sales enabled the company to identify its most and least popular products and peak sales periods, which could guide strategic decisions. The project demonstrated my skills in data analysis, data modeling, and the use of Power BI as a tool for business intelligence.
